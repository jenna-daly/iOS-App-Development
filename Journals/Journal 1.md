Journal 1

    For this week I picked one project from the 4 ideas I had. I thought picking the app would be the 
easiest part of this project, but it actually ended up being a lot harder. I wanted to come up with a new 
idea that wasnâ€™t already out there and with the app idea I chose (campus map) I think it fulfills that. 
It also allows me to learn a lot more beyond basic Swift with the features I plan to look into if time 
allows. Right now after making my project plan I think I should have time to try those features which
I am looking forward to, especially learning about augmented reality in app development. I will be 
designing a wireframe for the app for this week but that should not be a challenge since I only plan on 
one UI screen. I also followed one of the online Xcode tutorials I found: https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=5b91dFhZz0g&t=1254s. I found it helpful to follow along. Although he was not super descriptive in
what every function he coded did, I was able to get more familiar with how to use Xcode and some different
features.
