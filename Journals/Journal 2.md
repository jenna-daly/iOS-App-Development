Journal 2

For this week I actually started developing the basic UI in Xcode without functionality, aside from button presses. I mostly followed the wireframes I created but found a few additional things I had not thought of. For example, when the user opens the app I do not want to display an arrow until a location is selected, so I had to create a placeholder to fill all that empty space. I also ran into the issue of needing a back button so if you select add a location but then change your mind you can still return to the main screen. That is something I am still looking into. Xcode has a lot of different things you can add so I am trying to find the best way to nav back. I thought the app idea would only take 3 weeks for full development and so far I think I am on track but I do think I will run into more issues like this where I find I forgot to include certain features. I also watched two tutorials on requesting and using user location. I ran into trouble trying to follow the tutorial. For some reason my Xcode build looked different from the video and from the other projects I created, and I have not yet been able to figure out why. But, I do have a better understanding on it and will continue to watch a few more videos. Right now the most challenging thing I forsee is having to get all the basic user locations stored. I am still looking into the different db options and haven't chosen yet.
