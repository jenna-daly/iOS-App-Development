Finalized App Proposal

Idea: Campus Map

Basics to implement:
-One screen UI<br/>
	-Has an html box at the top of the screen. When pressed, a scroll through text area 
appears on the bottom. After making a selection, the html box will update to display the 
location user wants to go to.<br/>
-In the middle of the screen is an arrow that points users in general direction of destination. Will readjust based on paths user chooses.<br/>
-Add a plus icon, when the user presses it it will access their current location and allow them to name it, then save it to the preloaded location list.

If time allows:
-Add an augmented reality feature so on the user’s phone they can see what is actually in front of them in real time.<br/>
	-To add onto that feature, add a feature where facts will come up about certain buildings
that are shown through the AR feature.<br/>
-Apply geofences as opposed to one GPS coordinate to represent locations.<br/>
-Add a google maps feature where user can see their location and destination so they know how far/close they are.

Timeline
Design the front end look/wireframes in Xcode - 1 week <br/>
Implement the working features- get user’s location, put in coordinates to represent each location, get arrow working to get user from point A to B - 3 weeks<br/>
If time allows features: starting in the order they are listed above - 3 weeks<br/>
Formalize the how-to guide, either as a video tutorial or a write up - 1 week<br/>
